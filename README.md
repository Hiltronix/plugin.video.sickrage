# Known Issues  

TV Show Cast Members...  
- TV show information shows cast member names from theTVdb.com but no cast member images.  
- TV episode information shows neither cast member names or images.
- This is a current limitation of the metahandler library I'm using from TV show/episode lookups.  The author Eldorado may add these features in an upcoming release.
