## Known Issues  

#### SickBeard Limitations & Issues:  
- Sickbeard does not (and devs won't add, last I checked) a function call to retrieve the API key, so hackish screen scraping is required to auto-retrieve the API Key.  
  This may break, so manual entry of API Key may be required.  
- The SickBeard API does not allow for retrieving the backlog list at this time.
