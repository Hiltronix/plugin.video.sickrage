2015-06-08  by Hiltronix v.1.0.0
- Expanded original work done by Zach Moore (v.1.0.10), and adapted for SickRage.
- Updated icon images for SickRage.
- Allow for manual entry for SickRage API Key value.
  Original work did not run on SickRage due to the hackish scraping of the webpage to get the API Key.
  On SickRage the API Key is on the second tab of the webpage, and not in the same screen location as SickBeard.
  Added the API Key to the settings page solved this problem.  UI's are always subject to change, and scraping the webpage is a point of failure.

- Fix URL for retreiving images from SickRage.
- Fixed "Manage Shows > Force Search" not working to become Force Show Update. 
- Added the same context menu to the "Coming Episodes" show list as the "Manage Shows" list.
- Added "Paused" status text after show names for show "Pause/Resume" status.
- Added show posters to all lists.
- Added show and episode information lookups from theTVdb.com.
- Allow for escaping/exiting prompts without continuing.
- Updated 'Add New Show' to include "Any" selection and updated code.

- Added "Continuing/Ended" status to show list.
- Added "Aired Date" to episode list.
