2015-08-08 v.1.3.2
- Cache generic images for posters, fanart and banners when server can't supply one.  This speeds up building show lists considerably.
- Catch and ignore json error messages when image files are requested from SickRage/SickBeard but not found.

2015-08-07 v.1.3.1
- Added Media View options for alternative screen formats. 
- Fan art is now downloaded and cached as well.  There is a delay when downloading images for caching the first time and after clearing cache.
- Added sort selection to 'Show List'.
- Fixed a unicode issue.
- Warning before allowing you to clear image cache.

2015-08-06 v.1.3.0
- Speed improvements in folder lists.
- When adding a new show, it now checks if show already exists, instead of just giving a generic error message.
- If the 'Video Lookup' context menu add-on is installed, it's added to the custom context menus.

2015-07-30 v.1.2.3
- Added Sickbeard compatibility.  Option switch in Settings > Login.
    SickBeard Limitations & Issues:
        - Sickbeard does not (and devs won't add) a function call to retrieve the API key, so hackish screen scraping is required to auto-retrieve the API Key.
            - This may break, so manual entry of API Key may be required.
        - The SickBeard API shares images in thumbnail size (small/low-res) unless a startup parameter is used of '--noresize' without the quotes.
        - The SickBeard API does not allow for retrieving the backlog list.
- Bug fixes.

2015-07-29 v.1.2.2
- Poster images are now cached locally, downloadied from the server instead of accessing them directly.  Making it more compatible with SickBeard, and speeding things up slightly.
- Added Settings option to enable a 'Clear Image Cache' feature in the main menu.  Allowing new images to be retrieved from the server, or simply freeing up space locally from deleted shows.

2015-07-28 v.1.2.1
- Fix issue with context menus selections complaining about missing API Key.
- API Key is now stored in the addon settings on the system when retrieved using username/password, and isn't being retrieved each time it's needed.  Making server calls slightly faster.

2015-07-26 v.1.2.0
- Added timeout feature to all data access attempts to the server.  Otherwise add-on and/or Kodi/XBMC would hang when server was not responding.

2015-07-19 v.1.1.3
- Added "Status for all future episodes" prompt to "Add New Show" to allow for changes made to SickRage.  Committed Pull Request to SickRage project to update WebAPI accordingly.

2015-07-15 v.1.1.2
- Added log file icon.
- Fixed issues with "Add New Show", to notify when no show found, and trap errors properly when query is unsuccessful.

2015-07-14 v.1.1.1
- Added log file viewer to main menu.  Opt-out option in settings.
- Made context menus more consistent throughout with similar selections in the same order.

2015-07-11 v.1.1.0

- Changed menu item "Manage Shows" to "Show List".
- Added episode list to context menus; Upcoming, History, Backlog.
- Added season number to episode listing.
- Fixed episode details when selected from episode listing, when episode is a single digit number.

2015-07-02 v.1.0.11
- Improved API Key retrieval.  No longer scraping webpage.

2015-06-30 v.1.0.10
- Added "Set Episode Status" to History context menu.
- Added air date to Backlog listing.
- Updated icon images (Kodi/XBMC only refreshes the icon cache every 24 hours or so, before you to see new images when updating versions.)
- Fix for API Key not being retrieved using username/password on some devices.

2015-06-29 v.1.0.9
- Reinstated the hackish API key scraping from the webserver page, using updated scraping code.
  Manually typing and pasting the API key is still preferred as less fallable, as it's not dependant on changes made to webserver pages.
  But typing 32 random characters or copy/pasting may be difficult on set top boxes.
- Added helpful notes to Settings > Login screen.
- Fixed "Add New Show" bug introduced by "Option to skip keyboard".
- Added error messages for possible JSON retrieval errors.

2015-06-28 v.1.0.8

  Examples:
    RunPlugin(plugin://plugin.video.sickrage?action=addshow&tvdb_id=TVDB_ID)
    RunPlugin(plugin://plugin.video.sickrage?action=addshow&show_name=SHOW_NAME)

2015-06-23 v.1.0.3
- Updated icons.

2015-06-20 v.1.0.2

- Changed version of "script.module.metahandler" that exists on the official Kodi repository.

2015-06-08  by Hiltronix v.1.0.0
- Expanded original work done by Zach Moore (v.1.0.10), and adapted for SickRage.
- Updated icon images for SickRage.
- Allow for manual entry for SickRage API Key value.
  Original work did not run on SickRage due to the hackish scraping of the webpage to get the API Key.
  On SickRage the API Key is on the second tab of the webpage, and not in the same screen location as SickBeard.
  Added the API Key to the settings page solved this problem.  UI's are always subject to change, and scraping the webpage is a point of failure.
- Allow for SSL login (https) sites when retreiving images.
- Fix URL for retreiving images from SickRage.
- Fixed "Manage Shows > Force Search" not working to become Force Show Update. 
- Added the same context menu to the "Coming Episodes" show list as the "Manage Shows" list.
- Added "Paused" status text after show names for show "Pause/Resume" status.
- Added show posters to all lists.
- Added show and episode information lookups from theTVdb.com.
- Allow for escaping/exiting prompts without continuing.
- Updated 'Add New Show' to include "Any" selection and updated code.
- Added option to remove all files when deleting shows.
- Added text colour highlighting for quicker reading.
- Added "Continuing/Ended" status to show list.
- Added "Aired Date" to episode list.
- Changed "Manual Episode Search" to "Download Episode".
- Bug fixes.
