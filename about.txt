[COLOR gold]Overview[/COLOR]
This add-on is intended as a tool to follow your favourite TV shows, review episodes, and interact with likewise services.

[COLOR gold]Future Project Goals[/COLOR]
My future goals for this add-on is to allow it to optionally run independant of SickRage/SickBeard as a personalised TV show favourites info hub.  Bringing your favourite TV shows meta data together in one place, making it available offline, and being able to access it from the 10 foot interface.  
That simply means, it will do what it does now, with added features that interest me as a TV show fan.  And optionally maintain some of the same features without being dependant on SickRage/SickBeard.
